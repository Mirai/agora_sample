== Create a Rails application, complete with all unit and functional tests that:

* Accepts personal information (first name (required), last name (required), address (required), phone number (not required), email (required)) from both a form and via a Restful API

* Saves records to an instance of MySQL

* Provides a way to search the contacts database by name (support for partial matches not needed)

* Ensures the application performs validations where appropriate


== Bonus:

* On successful creation of a new account, inform a queue (e.g. Redis, Sparrow, etc.) that a new account was created

* Write a listener for the queue that will update account record to indicate that it was "verified"

* Demonstrate a set of integration test(s) to verify the system works appropriately
